
# 🚀 CHAPTER 1: SETTING UP KAFKA WITH DOCKER
# 
# 🎯 GOAL: Get Kafka running on your computer using Docker
# Think of this like setting up a post office in your neighborhood!
#
# 📚 WHAT YOU'LL LEARN:
# - How to use Docker to run Kafka
# - How to check if Kafka is working
# - How to stop Kafka when you're done

# 📋 STEP-BY-STEP INSTRUCTIONS FOR 9TH GRADERS:

# STEP 1: Install Docker (if you haven't already)
# 🐳 Docker is like a magic box that can run software without installing it directly
# Think of it like a virtual computer inside your computer!
# 
# Download from: https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop
# 
# Why Docker? 
# - No complex Kafka installation needed
# - Works the same on Windows, Mac, and Linux
# - Easy to start and stop
# - Doesn't mess up your computer

# STEP 2: Open Your Command Terminal
# 💻 This is where you'll type commands to control your computer
#
# On Windows: Open PowerShell
# - Press Windows key + R
# - Type "powershell" and press Enter
# - You'll see a dark window with text
#
# On Mac: Open Terminal
# - Press Cmd + Space
# - Type "terminal" and press Enter
# - You'll see a window with text
#
# On Linux: Open Terminal
# - Press Ctrl + Alt + T
# - You'll see a window with text

# STEP 3: Navigate to Your Project Folder
# 📁 You need to go to the folder that contains the kafka-single-node.yml file
#
# Use the "cd" command (cd = "change directory")
# Example: cd /Users/yourname/kafka-project
#
# 💡 TIP: You can drag the folder from your file explorer into the terminal
# and it will automatically type the path for you!

# STEP 4: Start Kafka with Docker
# 🚀 This is the magic command that starts your Kafka "post office"

docker-compose -f kafka-single-node.yml up -d

# 🔍 WHAT THIS COMMAND DOES:
# - docker-compose: Tool that manages multiple Docker containers
# - -f kafka-single-node.yml: Use this specific configuration file
# - up: Start the services
# - -d: Run in "detached" mode (in the background)
#
# You should see output like:
# "Creating network..."
# "Creating kafka..."
# "Creating zookeeper..."

# STEP 5: Check if Kafka is Running
# 🔍 This command shows you all running Docker containers

docker ps

# 🔍 WHAT YOU SHOULD SEE:
# A table showing containers with names like:
# - kafka (the message broker)
# - zookeeper (Kafka's helper service)
#
# If you see these, congratulations! Kafka is running! 🎉

# STEP 6: When You're Done - Stop Kafka
# 🛑 This command stops and removes the Kafka containers

docker-compose -f kafka-single-node.yml down

# 🔍 WHAT THIS COMMAND DOES:
# - down: Stop and remove the services
# - This frees up your computer's memory
# - Removes the containers but keeps the configuration
#
# You should see output like:
# "Stopping kafka..."
# "Stopping zookeeper..."
# "Removing kafka..."
# "Removing zookeeper..."

# 🎓 IMPORTANT CONCEPTS FOR BEGINNERS:
#
# 🐳 DOCKER CONTAINERS:
# - Like virtual computers that run specific software
# - Each container is isolated (can't interfere with others)
# - Easy to start, stop, and remove
#
# 🏗️ DOCKER COMPOSE:
# - Tool that manages multiple containers together
# - Uses YAML files to define what containers to run
# - Perfect for complex applications like Kafka
#
# 🍯 ZOOKEEPER:
# - Kafka's "assistant" that helps coordinate things
# - Keeps track of Kafka brokers and topics
# - Always runs alongside Kafka
#
# 📬 KAFKA BROKER:
# - The actual message-handling service
# - Like the main post office that sorts and delivers mail
# - Where your applications will send and receive messages

# 🚨 TROUBLESHOOTING TIPS:
#
# Problem: "Command not found"
# Solution: Make sure Docker Desktop is installed and running
#
# Problem: "Port already in use"
# Solution: Stop other Kafka instances or restart your computer
#
# Problem: "Permission denied"
# Solution: On Mac/Linux, try adding "sudo" before the command
#
# Problem: Containers not showing in "docker ps"
# Solution: Check "docker ps -a" to see stopped containers, then restart

# 🎯 NEXT STEPS:
# Once Kafka is running, you can:
# 1. Create topics (like creating new mailboxes)
# 2. Send messages (like mailing letters)
# 3. Receive messages (like checking your mailbox)
# 4. Build applications that use Kafka
